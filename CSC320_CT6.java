/*
Option #2 - Create a Method to Return a String Array

Write program with a method that returns an array. The method should accept 
as input a comma-delimited string with three values from a user. 

The array should store each value in a different element. 

Use Try..Catch error handling and print any failure messages, or print 
success from within method if execution is successful 
(see Chapter 6 in the text). 

Call the method from the main method of the program to demonstrate its 
functionality by looping through the array and printing the individual values.

        String userInput[] = new String[3];
        //Intro
        System.out.println("Please Input 3 Strings(Words) and I will repeat them.");

        //Get Input from user

        //Call method to store user's input into 3 element array

        //Print out array
